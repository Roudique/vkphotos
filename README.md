## Disclaimer

- ‚ö†Ô∏è  The repository contains tons of comments and todos in **Russian** language
- üö´  I deleted all assets except App logo because the license requires it
- üî¨  This source code is not for production and not for distribution. I made it just for educational purposes

## Requirements

- Xcode 9 and later
- iOS 11 and later
- Swift 4 and later
- [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

## Try App

You can try **VK Photos** by downloading the app to your iPhone from App Store. It's **free** (*iOS 11+ required*)

[![AppStore Link](https://github.com/Stmol/vkphotos/blob/master/.readme/app-store-badge.jpg)](https://vk.cc/8xwT04)

## Installation

- Create VK application: [vk.com](https://vk.com/editapp?act=create)
- Obtain your VK app ID and insert it into `AppDelegate.swift`
- Run Carthage: ```$ carthage update --platform ios```
- Install Firebase SDK: [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#frameworks) *(or just mute all Analytics calls, you probably dont need it)*
- ...
- *and unfortunately no matter how perfect you are all done you will not be able to run the application in the simulator*

## Why app doesn't display anything when running in simulator? (or just crash)

Because **VK Photos** app use many custom API calls.

To simplify the logic of the app in some places I wrote a lot of custom API using greate [execute](https://vk.com/dev/execute) method. These methods are stored on the VK API servers and accessible only to my VK application. For obvious reasons, these methods I can not disclose.
